due to the integration with a complex external protocol


[10/03/2023 21:04] ktnowk
Yeah, there's definitely a learning curve since it's an ambient integration. With well-known protocols like uniswap or compound we can expect wardens to already understand the underlying protocol. Since ambient is new, likely most people won't know about it. We tried to include the background info we thought was necessary for the audit. If you guys have any other questions about ambient, please don't hesitate to ask

differnece between  Canto and Ambient  ?


[10/04/2023 05:12] ktnowk
Ambient is a dex, Canto is building a liquidity mining protocol for Ambient dex

basically means we are trying to create a protocol that can incentivize liquidity in Ambient


[10/04/2023 05:16] 0x11singh99
Canto is blockchain  or just a org.

[10/04/2023 09:38] mysticalpistachio
Can we call LiquidityMiningPath.sol functions directly for security testing / poc , or it has to be through protocolCmd / userCmd in order to respect the original test case ?


[10/04/2023 10:02] lambda9382
Calling them directly will result in wrong results, because the call paths do not hold any state. All state is held by the `CrocSwapDex` contract, which `delegatecall`s to the call paths. That's  similar to the ERC-2535 Diamond pattern (where the facets are `delegatecall`ed from the diamond) in case you are familiar with this


[10/04/2023 10:12] mysticalpistachio

[10/04/2023 13:31] ktnowk
ambient rewards = rewards for uni v2 style, constant product AMM liquidity

concentrated rewards = rewards for uni v3 style (concentrated) liquidity


[10/04/2023 13:31] ktnowk
i think you might need to let it run a bit longer


[10/04/2023 13:31] ktnowk
it can take a while for contracts to compile. once they are compiled it's cached so subsequent scripts/tests will run quickly


[10/04/2023 13:42] sovaslava9
so.. user could get rewards, using 2 functions and 1 poolId?


[10/04/2023 13:44] _carla_

@kt_nowk send a dm :gummy_wink:


[10/04/2023 13:48] banditx0x
I think yes, if you deposit concentrated liquidity and ambient liquidity into the same pool, you get rewards


[10/04/2023 13:48] banditx0x
However this is by design, as the rewards are proportional to the amount of liquidity you provide. You will have to split your capital between concentrated and ambient liquidity if you do this,


[10/04/2023 17:59] banditx0x

tick size in Ambient is actually customizable. 

if you're curious you can check it out in pool templates

however, we will be using the same tick sizes as Uni v3 where 1 tick = 1 bps, or 0.01%


[10/04/2023 23:13] sovaslava9

[10/04/2023 23:31] banditx0x
A user can create multiple concentrated liquidity positions in a single pool. These positions are rewarded for and accounted seperately. The concentratedLiquidity functions take in `(address payable owner, bytes32 poolIdx, int24 lowerTick, int24 upperTick)` In the same pool you can have different position ranges corresponding to different lower ticks and upper ticks

i think it would be great if there was some kinda internship/fellowship program here. or maybe the expert auditors allow some new auditors to work with them and assist them in their work. this way both would benefit.


[10/04/2023 23:37] doogiedog
There seems to be a large step between writing your own solidity contracts and auditing them that's hard to make. Seem to need to know the fundamentals of the protocol before even starting, like tick math and AMM concepts.

What is tickTracking, how does it works


[10/05/2023 08:01] lambda9382
Only the changes that are mentioned in the contest page, the rest of `MarketSequencer.sol` that is not mentioned in the contest page was not changed


[10/05/2023 08:02] lambda9382
The array stores the information when a tick is entered / exited. Whenever one is entered, a new entry is appended (with the entry timestamp) and when the tick is exited, the exit timestamp of this entry is set


[10/05/2023 08:22] _3doc_
The contest scope seems quite specific on the lines that were changed in pre-existing contracts. If a bug comes from something that "should've been changed" and was not, would that be in scope?


[10/05/2023 08:39] vad37
I am having trouble understanding which contract is using two RangePosition in storage layout.
New `LiquidityMining` obviously using new `potitions72_` storage as from new deployed contract sidecar.
Who is accessing old `position_` though, I know it go through old version `TradeMatcher.lookupPosition`. So previous deployed sidecar must still have access to this storage so user can withdraw their old deposit/position


[10/05/2023 08:41] vad37
Does old `positions_` storage become deprecated after new sidecar update? Or the new `positions72` not backward compatible with old position and only used for new `LiquidityMiningPath`?


[10/05/2023 08:44] lambda9382
I would say so, yes

{Reactions}
üëç 

[10/05/2023 08:46] lambda9382
In our case that is not really relevant because we will do the initial deployment in this state, so there will be no old positions to consider. Not sure how Ambient manages this, they may have a sidecar for migration


[10/05/2023 08:48] vad37
So this is a fork project and a completely new deployment?


[10/05/2023 08:50] lambda9382
Yes, it is a fork of https://ambient.finance/, but the Ambient DEX does not exist so far on CANTO, so it will also be the first deployment of Ambient on CANTO

The scope is only what you can find under https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-canto/blob/main/scope.txt, meaning the 2 contracts
The lines mentioned after the Scope table [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-canto#ambient-hooks-where-functions-in-liquidityminingsol-are-called) are just for context

[10/05/2023 14:48] lambda9382
That's the initialization. When a tick is currently in range, we need to start the accrual from the current tracking data because the user is eligible for rewards for parts of the time that this tick was in-range (starting from the moment when they provided liquidity). When a tick is not in range, we never need to consider the historical tracking data because these are in the past when the user did not provide liquidity yet


[10/05/2023 14:50] saint6704
but user can only have 1 ambient liquidity position right?

The protocol wouldn't be permissionless if you put access controls on important functions. By putting access controls in comments, you allow anybody to call the function but indicate to users "plz don't call this, it might hurt the protocol üòø "

These functions were integrated into the Ambient access control system, which is a bit complicated: The functions in the callpaths cannot be called directly on the dex itself, the dex only performs delegatecalls to the `userCmd` and `protocolCmd` of each callpath. `protocolCmd` is only callable by privileged addresses. This is implemented here with the `protocolOnly` modifier:

Yea, all submissions are counted whether QA, gas, M or H


[10/07/2023 11:05] banditx0x
Are right i get it


[10/07/2023 11:05] banditx0x
but aren't all indivudal submissions supposed to be H/M


[10/07/2023 11:06] banditx0x
even though they may get downgraded to Low/QA?


[10/07/2023 11:06] banditx0x
I thought Low/QA/Gas was submitted in a singular report


[10/07/2023 11:06] superman_i4g
Lol, nope


[10/07/2023 11:07] superman_i4g
Yep, that‚Äôs what am saying, all submissions are counted. QA,Gas, analysis

Hey guys! How does the judging process work? Like do we get any updates in when the primarly results will come?


[10/11/2023 13:05] lsaudit
It usually takes 4-6 weeks for the result (sometimes quicker). If you don't have backstage role access - you can check the status at: https://www.dailywarden.com/


[10/11/2023 16:15] lsdan
After the contest ends the pre sort phase starts. Then the repo is handed to the sponsor. After the sponsor is done the judge does the final grading. Finally there is a post-judging qa period for backstage wardens to point out anything the judge may have missed. The normal target is 2 weeks for the whole process, but in practice it usually takes a few weeks longer.


[10/11/2023 16:16] lsdan
This one should be reasonably quick because there are not too many reports


[10/11/2023 16:17] lsdan
If I‚Äôm not mistaken the contest is being reviewed by the sponsor at this time. I‚Äôm the judge so feel free to ask for updates on where it‚Äôs at in the process here and tag me. I‚Äôll do my best to respond quickly.

is there an escalation period in c4?üòÇ


[10/17/2023 16:11] lsdan
Post judging QA is 72 hours. I would expect next week.


[10/17/2023 16:19] xariextz
The results are preliminar or definitive when announced here?

[10/19/2023 17:25] lsdan
Friendly reminder not to just start pinging the judges or sponsors. Rules state you should ask first. Also, there is a time and a place for everything. After a contest closes, that time and place are post-judging qa.

Unfortunately post judging QA is there for Backstage wardens to have these discussions. If you missed the opportunity there isn't really anything that can be done as judging is now finalised. You're welcome to start a discussion on the repo as you already have access to it as a Backstage warden.

Someone even dropped a comment on my behalf (since I didn‚Äôt have backstage role) but it seems it wasn‚Äôt considered as escalation‚Ä¶C4 really need to reconsider this backstage role of a thing cus in reality it‚Äôs doing more harm than good.
