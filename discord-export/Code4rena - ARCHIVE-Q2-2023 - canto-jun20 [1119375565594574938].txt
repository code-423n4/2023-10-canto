Hey all! Super excited for this audit. Here's a video i've recorded giving a high level overview of the onboarding module:

Understanding the Onboarding Module 🤔
Hey there! In this Loom, I'll be explaining how the onboarding module works. Essentially, it's a middleware that automates the process of bridging tokens from other IBC-enabled blockchains to Kanto. The module checks if the user has less than 4Canto and if the IBC token is registered to the onboarding module. If so, it swaps a small amount of t...

@kt_nowk Hey friend, "the onboarding process is non-atomic, meaning that even if the swap or conversion fails, it does not revert IBC transfer and the asset transferred to the Canto network will still remain in the Canto network."  would elaborate that more if possible.. the asset will transfer anyway ?


[06/20/2023 20:40] t_k___
Sure. If you send a token from Ethereum to Canto using an IBC transfer, the IBC transfer will still be successful in the event that the swap for 4 canto or the automatic ERC20 conversion fails. 

In other words, your IBC transfer will never be reverted because of the onboarding process. If you send tokens to Canto using IBC, they will always end up on Canto (never back to the origin chain)

When submitting a finding, the site shows

Does that apply to this contest too ?

If the step of convert IBC coins to ERC20 fails, the IBC get transferred from the origin chain to Canto chain, but as the conversion to ERC20 fail what is the intention for funds recovery? ...a manual adjustment?


[06/23/2023 03:03] t_k___
there's a separate function users can call to convert from IBC voucher to ERC20

currently users do that manually in the bridging process, so if that step were to fail during the middleware, users could always go back to the manual process to recover

I've just submitted an Analysis report, you choose one of the two types and then you get a prompt with bullet points to cover.

Could you please refer to the file that has this functionality (i.e. manual bridging process)?


[06/23/2023 14:17] t_k___
the manual bridging process is 2 steps: IBC transfer, and then ERC20 convert

the erc20 conversion happens in the x/erc20 module

@kt_nowk is the standard token supposed to be Canto?


[06/23/2023 17:57] t_k___
yes


[06/23/2023 17:58] t_k___
try  `make install` in the base Canto directory


[06/23/2023 17:58] t_k___
and then go into the x/onboarding and run `go test ./...`


[06/23/2023 18:01] dwward3n
curious, test runs without `make install`
is it because im just running tests for coinswap and onboarding?


[06/23/2023 18:04] t_k___
it will depend on how you have your go configured but it seems like the issue above is an issue with missing certain packages.

either that, or you have to run tests from outer directory and not just single file since there are imports from other modules


[06/23/2023 18:05] t_k___
technically should not have to make install


[06/23/2023 18:18] dwward3n
can you elaborate on `Double swaps are disabled`


[06/23/2023 18:30] t_k___
swaps can't go through two pools


[06/23/2023 18:30] t_k___
so if there is canto/eth pool and canto/usdc pool, can't make swap with eth/usdc


[06/23/2023 19:34] dwward3n
I can't find issues here, haha

It was up to the warden if he wanted to receive awards in canto. But only those warden would be awarded with canto who applied for receiving awards in canto at the start of contest. If you didn’t applied for receiving awards in canto then you will get awards in USDC.
