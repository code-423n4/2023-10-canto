 * 
 * @dev Note that this mixin works with the full set of possible int24 values.
 *      Whereas other parts of the protocol set a MIN_TICK and MAX_TICK that are
 *      that well within the type bounds of int24. It's the responsibility of

    /* Tick positions are stored in three layers of 8-bit/256-slot bitmaps. Recursively
     * they indicate whether any given 24-bit tick index is active.

     * The first layer (lobby) represents the 8-bit tick root. If we did store this
     * layer, we'd only need a single 256-bit bitmap per pool. However we do *not*
     * store this layer, because it adds an unnecessary SLOAD/SSTORE operation on
     * almost all operations. Instead users can query this layer by checking whether
     * mezzanine key is set for each bit. The tradeoff is that lobby bitmap queries
     * are no longer O(1) random access but O(N) seeks. However at most there are 256
     * SLOAD on a lobby-layer seek, and spills at the lobby layer are rare (moving 
     * between multiple lobby bits requires a 65,000% price change). This gas tradeoff
     *  is virtually always justified. 
     *
     * The second layer (mezzanine) maps whether each 16-bit tick root is set. An 
     * entry will be set if and only if *any* tick index in the 8-bit range is set. 
     * Because there are 256^2 slots, this is represented as a map from the first 8-
     * bits in the root to individual 8-bit/256-slot bitmaps for the middle 8-bits 
     * at that root. 
     *
     * The final layer (terminus) directly maps whether individual tick indices are
     * set. Because there are 256^3 possible slots, this is represnted as a mapping 
     * from the first 16-bit tick root to individual 8-bit/256-slot bitmaps of the 
     * terminal 8-bits within that root. */
